### What's this?
The genious [Most Dangerous Writting App](http://www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com/) by [Manuel Elbert](https://www.twitter.com/maebert) [(source)](github.com/maebert/themostdangerouswritingapp) ported as an R/Shiny app by [Vincent Bonhomme](http://www.twitter.com/vincentbonhomme).

Written for the pleasure of learning shiny and `kerouac::kerouac()`ing while degugging.

Made during a rainy day and, yet working, probably not the most optimized app ever.

Install it with:

	devtools::install_github("vbonhomme/kerouac")
	
Then:

	kerouac::kerouac()
	
Or:

	library(kerouac)
	kerouac()
